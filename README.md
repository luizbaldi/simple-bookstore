# Simple Bookstore Project
This project is a simple bookstore built with pure javascript and bootstrap, using restifydb for the backend of aplication

##Intention
The ideia of this project came from a college project, during the Software Engineer course.
This project should be built with only pure javascript fuctions, with the intention of learn more about the basic javascript structure.
As we can't use frameworks, I decided to use PHP to create the templates and import them on the pages, so we can make changes on just one file.
